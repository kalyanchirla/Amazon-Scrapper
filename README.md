# Amazon-Scrapper

Performed web-scraping on www.amazon.co.uk using python and its package Beautiful Soup. 

The main aim of this project is to retrieve 50 best selling book from amazon for each and every category. A seperate csv file is generated for each and every category to look into.

Anyone can run the code to generate `CATEGORY_NAME.csv` for every book category present. The csv file contains book name, book URL, author name, rating, number of reviews, format of the book, price.
